This is a public repository of all of the crazy stuff I mess around with.  In
here, you'll find shell scripts I wrote to carry out certain tasks, ideas that
made me go "Hmmmm....", source code, and whatever else I happened to be messing
with at the time.  Some of you may find it helpful or interesting, some of you
may not.

A subset of this code may not work, so beware.

Good luck.

init-killswitch.sh - A hacked /bin/init shell script from Gentoo Linux that is
supposed to go into your initrd when you recompile the kernel.  The idea is
that it asks you for your password twice - the first time as if you'd mistyped
it, the second time as if you'd typed it correctly.  If you gave a different
pre-defined passphrase the first time that's hardcoded in the script it'll
wipe the LUKS headers of your encrypted root volume and wreck the system
(assuming that you created a single LUKS volume and used LVM inside of it).
I haven't tested this yet so be careful.  If you wreck your system I'm not
responsible.

add_jumpstart_pxe_client.sh - A shell script for Solaris that automagically
adds hosts to a Jumpstart server's client list.  Written for Solaris 10/x86.
Will probably work on Solars 10/SPARC as well.

fan_modes.sh - A SYSV-style initscript for manually controlling i8k fans on
Dell laptops.  Itch scratched.

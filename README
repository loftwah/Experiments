This is a public repository of all of the crazy stuff I mess around with.  In
here, you'll find shell scripts I wrote to carry out certain tasks, ideas that
made me go "Hmmmm....", source code, and whatever else I happened to be messing
with at the time.  Some of you may find it helpful or interesting, some of you
may not.

A subset of this code may not work, so beware.

Good luck.
